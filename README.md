* [reflection](https://github.com/Zewo/Reflection): After the first version which used the swift mirror mechanism, HandyJSON had imported the reflection library and rewrote some code for class properties inspecting.
* [ObjectMapper](https://github.com/tristanhimmelman/ObjectMapper): To make HandyJSON more compatible with the general style, the Mapper function support Transform which designed by ObjectMapper. And we import some testcases from ObjectMapper.
